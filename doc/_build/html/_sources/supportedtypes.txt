   contain the root `toctree` directive.


Supported types
===============

Of course this is a just a simple example where a class has only one attribute of string type.
But, you have another options to use like you'll see below.

PyEnty supports the types of string, int, float and list through the following classes ::

    Str() - string
    Int() - int
    Float() - float
    List(typeof=) - a typed list which only accepts items of the same type: ex.: List(int), List(User) and etc.
